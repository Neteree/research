I have put all examples of my practice/code into the practice_code folder and
within there you will be able to find more folders that are related to different modules
of this paper/course to help in assisting finding specific kinds of code more easily. 
I believe that pratice speaks louder than just words so I have tried
to keep it minimal here, however all my code is heavily commented to help avoid any confusion
that may occur and to be clear as possible about my code
